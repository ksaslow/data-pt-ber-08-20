*This is a test file to play around with the markdown format*

### Merge conflicts in git

(For my reference:) I have not been able to run the git upstream pull command because I have merge conflicts.

I think the merge conflict is because when I pushed my lab solutions to git after W1D2, I accidentally pushed them to the new branch I created in class "newfeature". So I went to github and merged this branch to my master branch manually.
*This was a mistake*
**A big mistake**

This is a link to my forked repo on github:

#### Solving merge conflicts in git:

*To be continued...*
We will use markdown to solve merge conflicts! You can also do this is jupyter

This is my master branch.

This is what I am changing after making labconflict branch but checking out master again and making a change.
